HaZ started in video games but moved into feature film visual effects, eventually directing and producing a breakout feature film: THE BEYOND. The indie sci-fi flick climbed to No. 2 on the iTunes charts in 2018 before being licensed to Netflix. For his current project, RIFT, HaZ and his team aimed to simultaneously produce a game and a full-length feature film using Unreal Engine creation tools. To meet this ambitious goal, HaZ selected the ASUS ProArt PA32UCG for its long list of production-friendly features, including crisp 4K resolution, 10-bit color depth, 120 Hz refresh rate, and calibration presets. Coupled with a workstation featuring a ProArt Z490-Creator 10G motherboard, the team was empowered to bring his vibrant visions to life.
