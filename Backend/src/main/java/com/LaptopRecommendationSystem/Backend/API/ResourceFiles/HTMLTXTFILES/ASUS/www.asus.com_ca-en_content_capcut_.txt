CapCut Terms of Use CapCut promises to provide different membership benefits based on different eligible ASUS products (“CapCut Membership Benefits”). See the table below for details. For ASUS ProArt models, users can enjoy a maximum of 6 months of free CapCut Membership. The membership benefits begin from the first month of activation and login, lasting for a total of 180 days. Participants can activate these benefits every 30 days. To receive the benefits for a particular month, users must log in during that month. If they fail to log in, the benefits for that month will automatically lapse. Upon successful login, users will receive 30 days of membership benefits starting from the login date, with a maximum duration of 6 consecutive months. For ASUS Non-ProArt models, users are eligible for 1 month of free CapCut Membership. In addition, the CapCut Membership Benefits are subject to the following terms and conditions: If the Participant deletes the pre-installed CapCut or downloads the CapCut from other sources to replace the pre-installed CapCut, the Participant will not be able to receive the CapCut Membership Benefits. If the Participant restores eligible ASUS products to factory settings within 6 months after activating the membership benefits, the Participant will be able to continue using the unexpired membership benefits.
