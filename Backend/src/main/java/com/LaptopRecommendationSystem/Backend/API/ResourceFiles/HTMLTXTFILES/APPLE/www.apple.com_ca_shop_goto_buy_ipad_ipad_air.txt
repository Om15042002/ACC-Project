Apple Pencil (USB-C) pairs via USB-C Charge Cable and attaches magnetically for storage. Which keyboard will work with this iPad? Magic Keyboard for iPad Air is compatible with this iPad. Third-party keyboards are also available. What type of SIM does this iPad have? iPad Air includes eSIM technology that enables fast, convenient and secure activation of mobile data plans. There are a few ways to activate eSIM on your iPad, including transferring from another iPad, joining an existing iPhone data plan, adding a new plan in Settings, scanning a QR code or using an app from a network provider.** With eSIM, you can choose mobile data plans from selected network providers in more than 190 countries and regions around the world. Learn more about setting up eSIM. ** Not all network providers support eSIM. See your provider for more details. eSIM technology works with iPad Pro (M4), iPad Pro 11‑inch (1st generation and later), iPad Pro 12.9‑inch (3rd generation and later), iPad Air (M2 and M3), iPad (A16), iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (7th generation and later), iPad mini (A17 Pro) and iPad mini (5th and 6th generation). What are my financing options? You can finance eligible items when you choose to check out with Affirm monthly payments. Add a trade-in to any eligible product and pay even less. We’ll apply your trade-in value as an instant credit, reducing the amount you finance.‡ How does Apple Trade In work? The Apple Trade In programme makes it easy to trade in an eligible iPad. Just answer a few questions regarding the model and condition, and we will provide an estimated trade-in value* or a simple way to recycle it for free if it’s not eligible for credit. If your iPad is eligible and you accept the quote, we will send you a free trade-in kit, separate to your new iPad (at no cost to you), so you can then send in your current iPad within the 14-day return window. Once we receive your iPad, we’ll inspect it and verify its condition. If the condition matches what you described, there’s nothing more you need to do. If the condition doesn’t match, a new trade-in value will be provided. You’ll have the option to either accept this revised value or reject it. We’ll work with you to confirm that you still want to move forwards with the trade‑in. The trade-in process can take up to 2–3 weeks. You can also trade your device in at an Apple Store at the point of purchase; however, the trade-in value in-store may be different to the estimated trade-in value you received online.
