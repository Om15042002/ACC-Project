Room-filling sound. An intelligent assistant. Control your smart home. Works seamlessly with iPhone. Private and secure. Sound Nothing short of amazing. 360-degree audio Jam-packed with innovation, HomePod mini delivers unexpectedly big sound for a speaker of its size. At just under 8.5 centimetres tall, it takes up almost no space but fills the entire room with rich 360-degree audio that sounds amazing from every angle. Add more than one HomePod mini for truly expansive sound. Boundary-pushing computational audio creates the full, detailed tones of a much larger speaker — and HomePod mini turns it up without missing your voice commands. See how it works Mini sounds big. Crisp sound An Apple-designed full‑range driver uses an incredibly powerful neodymium magnet to deliver deep bass and crisp high frequencies. 360‑degree audio The unique acoustic waveguide directs sound out the bottom of the speaker, creating a 360‑degree audio field for consistent sound no matter where you are in the room. Balanced at any volume The tiny but powerful Apple S5 chip enables computational audio, which processes complex algorithms in real time, giving you balanced, fine‑tuned sound at any volume. Bass extension Apple-designed force‑cancelling passive radiators give HomePod mini incredible bass extension. Noise cancellation Four microphones work together to help cancel noise and listen for “Hey Siri” — even if your environment is loud, you don’t have to turn the volume down or move closer to be heard. Designed to fit anywhere in the house HomePod mini is designed to fit anywhere in the house. Its elegant shape is wrapped in a perfectly seamless mesh fabric that’s virtually transparent to the sound passing through it. A backlit touch surface on the top provides quick control.

Simply start an AirPlay session from your iPhone, or ask HomePod mini to play audio from apps on your iPhone using just your voice.6 Hey Siri, play pop hits in the bedroom Listen to tracks by song, artist, album, playlist, genre or lyrics.7 Hey Siri, play Canadaland Listen to Apple Podcasts and radio stations.

Siri can recognize the voices of up to six different family members on HomePod mini — and create a personalized experience for each person. So the music Dad hears when he asks for something he’d like is totally different from what the kids hear when they ask. And with Personal Requests, Siri can recognize a particular voice and relay that person’s information from iPhone apps like Messages, Calendar, Reminders and Contacts. And of course, HomePod mini keeps your information private and secure. Intercom spreads the word. With more than one HomePod mini in the house, you can easily communicate with your family members by voice using Intercom. Ask Siri to send your message to the whole house or to individual rooms — and everyone can easily respond. Hey Siri, intercom to the living room, Has the game started?

Private and secure A speaker that protects your right to privacy. Privacy is essential — especially in your own home. HomePod mini is designed to keep your personal information safe and be a trusted assistant in your family’s everyday life. Siri only listens for “Hey Siri” or “Siri” — so you can speak freely knowing nothing you say is sent out of your home until you activate Siri with a touch, or HomePod mini hears the magic words, “Hey Siri” or “Siri”. HomeKit secure video support With HomeKit Secure Video support, HomePod mini can analyze the feeds of your supported video cameras, detecting the presence of people and recognizing familiar faces, pets and cars. All video processing is done right on device before it’s sent end‑to‑end encrypted to iCloud — so your recordings can only be seen by you and the people you share them with, not Apple. Only you know what you're sayng to Siri When you ask Siri something, your request is associated with a random identifier, not your Apple Account. Siri uses on-device intelligence HomePod mini works with your iPhone for requests like hearing your messages or notes, so they are completed on device without revealing that information to Apple.
