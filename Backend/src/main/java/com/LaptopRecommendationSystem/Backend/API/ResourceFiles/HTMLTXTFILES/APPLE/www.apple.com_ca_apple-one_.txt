Answers. How do I sign up for Apple One? If you’re using an iPhone with iOS 14 or later, an iPad with iPadOS 14 or later, or a Mac with macOS Big Sur or later, tap or click here to sign up on our App Store. Or go to Settings > Account > Manage Subscriptions. And if it will save you money, we’ll automatically recommend an Apple One plan when you sign up for individual Apple subscriptions, based on the subscriptions you already have. What does it cost? Is it a monthly or annual subscription? Apple One is a monthly subscription service with no long-term commitment. The Individual plan is $22.95 per month, the Family plan is $28.95 per month and the Premier plan is $44.95 per month. Compared with paying for individual subscriptions, these plans offer a discount of up to 45%. You can cancel your subscription at any time at least a day before your monthly renewal date and you will have access until the end of the billing cycle you paid for. How do I access my Apple One subscriptions? Once you subscribe, you can enjoy your Apple One subscriptions anywhere they’re available, including the web (Apple Music and Apple TV+), Apple TV and select smart TVs (Apple Music, Apple TV+ and Apple Fitness+), Apple Watch (Apple Fitness+), Android devices (Apple Music) and other third-party streaming devices (Apple Music and Apple TV+). Do I get a free trial? And what does it include? Any subscriptions you don’t already have are free for the first month of your Apple One subscription.* If you currently pay for any of the subscriptions, you will continue to be charged for them separately until the Apple One trial is done and you switch to a paid Apple One plan. After the free trial, the plan automatically renews as a monthly subscription. And there’s no commitment — you can cancel in Settings > Apple Account at least a day before your monthly renewal date. What if I need more iCloud storage? You can purchase additional iCloud storage separately to supplement what’s included with your Apple One plan. Learn more Can I share with my family? How do I set it up? If you have the Apple One Family or Premier plan, you can use Family Sharing to share all included Apple subscriptions with up to five other family members without the need to share your password (Family Sharing does not happen automatically; you’ll need to set it up). And Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade always include Family Sharing, even in the Apple One Individual plan. iCloud+ Family Sharing works a bit differently than the other subscriptions; tap or click here to learn more. For all the subscriptions you share, family members will have private access across all their devices — they won’t see each other’s activity or have access to each other’s private documents and files. Learn how to set up Family Sharing How do I switch between individual subscriptions and Apple One subscriptions? Transitioning is easy. Simply follow the steps outlined above to sign up for Apple One. Any existing subscriptions that are included will automatically become part of your Apple One plan and you will no longer be billed separately for them. One exception is if you have an existing iCloud+ plan that includes more storage than your new Apple One plan — in that case, you will continue to be charged separately but you can cancel it. Tap or click here to learn more. If you cancel your Apple One plan at any time, you’ll have the opportunity to select any individual subscriptions you would like to keep and you’ll be billed separately for them. Your subscriptions will all continue right where you left off — you won’t lose customized content such as Apple Music playlists or Apple TV+ queues. Apple Footer * The Apple One free trial includes only subscriptions that you are not currently using through a free trial or a subscription. Plan automatically renews after trial until cancelled. Restrictions and other terms apply. ** Savings based on standard monthly pricing for subscriptions purchased separately. Apple Fitness+ requires an iPhone 8 or later or Apple Watch Series 3 or later paired with iPhone 6s or later. To get the newest features, make sure your devices are running the latest software version. Apple Fitness+ classes are taught in English with an option for subtitles in French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian and Brazilian Portuguese. Game availability for the 200+ titles across devices varies based on hardware and software compatibility. Some content may not be available in all areas.  Apple Entertainment Apple One Shop and Learn Shop and Learn Store Mac iPad iPhone Watch Vision AirPods TV & Home AirTag Accessories Gift Cards Apple Wallet Apple Wallet Wallet Apple Pay Account Account Manage Your Apple Account Apple Store Account iCloud.com Entertainment Entertainment Apple One Apple TV+ Apple Music Apple Arcade Apple Fitness+ Apple News+ Apple Podcasts Apple Books App Store Apple Store Apple Store Find a Store Genius Bar Today at Apple Group Reservations Apple Camp Apple Store App Certified Refurbished Apple Trade In Financing Order Status Shopping Help For Business For Business Apple and Business Shop for Business Business Financing For Education For Education Apple and Education Shop for K–12 Shop for University Education Financing For Healthcare For Healthcare Apple in Healthcare Mac in Healthcare Health on Apple Watch Health Records on iPhone and iPad Apple Values Apple Values Accessibility Education Environment Privacy Supply Chain About Apple About Apple Newsroom Apple Leadership Career Opportunities Investors Ethics & Compliance Events Contact Apple More ways to shop: Find an Apple Store or other retailer near you.
