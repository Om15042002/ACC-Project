It found that Studiobook really makes workflows seamless and smooth, and multitasking — working simultaneously between multiple files, or switching from graphic layouts to 3D, to motion or editing — is a great capability to have. For ProArt displays, what JL really appreciates are the pre-calibrated color settings. These make all the details in the shadows visible, and also offers true black. JL collaborates with a lot of different studios and artists. Coupling different artists' work with its Pro structure really creates the hybrid look and feel that JL wants for this project. Versatile and open JL believes in asking the right questions. It also believes that curious minds seek to explore all the possibilities that can lead to a good design — one that can have an effect on people and make them see things in a different light. JL is a team of planners, graphic and motion designers and project managers, coming with different backgrounds to contribute to the process. Versatile and open to new possibilities, the team strives to deliver designs that are thoughtful and sound, and stories that resonate. Going beyond Creativity is not limited to place, culture or language. Even in collaboration, JL works with artists who are not afraid to experiment and push the envelope. To go beyond what is expected, and fully open up the imagination. Gallery For ProArtists, By ProArtists Explore More ProArtists Learn More Canada/English ©ASUSTeK Computer Inc. All rights reserved.
