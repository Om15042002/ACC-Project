Sound Recognition requires the updated Home architecture, which is available as a separate update in the Home app. It requires all Apple devices that access the home to be using the latest software. Temperature and humidity sensing is optimised for indoor domestic settings, when ambient temperatures are around 15º C to 30º C and relative humidity is around 30% to 70%. Accuracy may decrease in some situations where audio is playing for an extended period of time at high volume levels.
