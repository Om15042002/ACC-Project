Available in countries where Wi-Fi 7 is supported. The specification for 802.11BE is a draft specification and is not final. If the final specification differs from the draft specification, it may affect the ability of the device to communicate with other 802.11BE devices. Bluetooth® 5.4 operation requires Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support. Until Microsoft OS/Chrome OS support is available, Bluetooth® 5.4 will function as Bluetooth® 5.3 or lower. .Camera resolution refers to the image sensor active pixels. The actual image capture pixels and aspect ratio depend on the app selected. Recharges your battery up to 50% within 30 minutes when the system is off (using “shut down” command).
