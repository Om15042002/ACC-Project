And the reasons are clear. Over the last several years, laptops have advanced to the point that many models have the speed and efficiency to match up with some of their desktop counterparts. What’s more, a laptop isn’t always just a laptop anymore. There are models that easily fold into a tablet, models with the power to run the hottest personal computers (PCs) games, and some models that are just as efficient as the rest but help cut costs. Some of our most popular laptops for college students might be: • Light and flexible 2 in 1 Yoga laptops are great for both study, downtime, and touchscreen interaction. • Legion gaming laptops hold the raw power to run today’s latest games but feature a more neutral design that blends into classroom environments. • Ultra-sturdy ThinkPad laptops that are ready for everything a university can throw at you, and then the business world beyond. Still, wondering where to go? Or what to choose? Don’t worry, we know, it sounds like there are a lot of choices out there. And there are. So, to help a bit more, we’ve broken down our top college laptops and computers by area of study. • Our best laptop for architecture students: ○ ThinkPad P Series • Our best laptop for computer science students: ○ ThinkPad P Series • Our best laptop for engineering students: ○ ThinkPad P Series • Our best laptops for programming students: ○ ThinkPad P Series • Our best laptop for medical students: ○ ThinkPad X1 Carbon • Our best laptop for nursing students: ○ ThinkPad X1 Carbon • Our best laptop for business students: ○ ThinkPad T Series • And our best laptops for graduate students: ○ ThinkPad Yoga Series Don’t fit into any of these laptops for college categories? Don’t worry. It’s easy to be overwhelmed by all the options available to you. Your chosen degree is one aspect that can help you find a laptop that is right for you. Another great way of figuring out which college laptop will meet your need is to make a list of all the ways you expect to use your computer. Lenovo ThinkPad for college students Lenovo ThinkPad laptops are tough as nails and reliable, giving you the tools, you need to stay productive. ThinkPad Yoga 2 in 1 laptops are designed with impact- and scratch-resistant glass that can withstand drops from desk height. You can open the laptop’s 360-degree hinge and use the screen as a drawing easel, watch lectures, and more. With the versatile ThinkPad, you have so many options for learning and completing projects. For a more stylish work solution, the ThinkBook series relies on an all-aluminum design, Dolby Audio™, and Dolby Vision® technology. College students will love the series Standby feature, which allows you to wake the laptop in under 0.5 seconds. While in Sleep mode, ThinkBook can still download files and play audio, which may be useful if you're conserving battery. Fortunately, ThinkBook delivers up to 10 hours of battery life on a single charge. Our best 2 in 1 laptop for college students Ready for something different? Our groundbreaking Yoga laptops, tablets, and 2 in 1s will turn heads — and you’ll find new ways to be productive on campus with them. Featuring bright screens, immersive audio, projectors, pen support, and an innovative keyboard, it has everything you need and more. It’s all yours to explore. For an ultra-thin and versatile student solution, the Yoga 2 in 1 series delivers plenty of power. Select Yoga series laptops even include a garaged pen that slides into the chassis, so you can take notes and draw directly on the display. With an ultra-thin and lightweight design that slides into a small book bag, college students can enjoy a powerful 2 in 1 experience anywhere on campus. If you're looking for a college student laptop that goes beyond surfing the web and productivity apps, we’ve got you covered. The Lenovo Flex series are full-fledged laptops that also double as tablets, thanks to their 360-degree hinge and full high definition (FHD) screens - perfect for streaming movies once the homework’s done. Our best laptops for gaming and college students There's nothing quite like losing yourself in an immersive story after a stressful midterm exam. Want the best laptop for college and gaming? Our premium Lenovo Legion and more affordable IdeaPad gaming laptops are great for college students who need a laptop for class, but also want to game with their pals when their work is done. These gaming laptops for college boast powerful processors, high-performance graphics, and overclockable central processing unit (CPU) options. Laptops for online classes If you want to use your laptop for online classes, Lenovo has top options for distance learning. Outfit your home office (or wherever you settle in) with the best laptops and tech. Need help deciding? Read about the tech you’ll need for remote learning in our handy frequently asked questions (FAQs). Expect more from a computer with a solid state drive (SSD) Today's college student computers look different because they are different. With SSDs and the latest in technology, you get speed, security, durability, and great design. We've taken a poll, and as it turns out, people are just happier when they go with a college student PC. How much should you spend on laptops for college students? Every college student has different priorities (depending on their field of study), and that means different computer requirements. An English literature major may not have the same CPU and graphics needs as a computer science or engineering student, for example. It's important to invest in a quality laptop that will serve you well for your entire academic run.
