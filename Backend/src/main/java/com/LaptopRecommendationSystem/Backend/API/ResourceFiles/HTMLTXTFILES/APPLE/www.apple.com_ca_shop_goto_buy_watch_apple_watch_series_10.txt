Apple Watch bands are available in a variety of styles and sizes. First, you’ll need to choose a case size and band style to see which band sizes are available with that combination. The band you choose will specify the maximum and minimum wrist size. To get the correct band size, we recommend that you precisely measure around your wrist. If you choose an Apple Watch with a Sport Band, first select your case size then select your band size. Sport Bands only come with one size in the box. If you choose a Solo Loop or Braided Solo Loop band, you’ll need to use the sizing guide to find your exact size. Our sizing for these bands has changed, so please use the updated sizing guide even if you’ve purchased one in the past. When you shop for Solo Loop bands, there are step-by-step instructions to help you measure your wrist using a printable tool or household objects so you can find the correct size. How do I customise my Apple Watch? You can pair any case with almost any band in the Apple Watch Studio. Once you’ve created a combination you like, you can save it and then create others to compare. What is the difference between GPS and GPS + Cellular? The GPS + Cellular model allows you to stay connected to the people and information you care about with just your Apple Watch. With a data plan you can send and receive text messages, answer phone calls, receive notifications, and stream Apple Music and Apple Podcasts without needing your iPhone nearby. To pair watches for kids who don’t have an iPhone yet using Apple Watch For Your Kids, a GPS + Cellular model is required. With the GPS model, you must be connected to your iPhone via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to send and receive text messages, answer phone calls and receive notifications. The built-in GPS works independently of your iPhone for distance, pace and route mapping in workouts.

You can finance eligible items when you choose to check out with Affirm monthly payments. Add a trade-in to any eligible product and pay even less. We’ll apply your trade-in value as an instant credit, reducing the amount you finance.‡ How does Apple Trade In work? Apple Trade In makes it easy to get credit toward the purchase of your next Apple Watch. Simply answer a few questions about your device. Based on what you tell us, we’ll provide an estimated trade-in value. If you pay monthly, we’ll apply the value as an instant credit to lower the monthly payments of your new Apple Watch. If you pay in full, we’ll credit your payment method after we receive your trade-in. If it’s not eligible for credit, you can recycle it for free. Once you accept the estimated trade-in value quote, we'll ship you a free, trade-in kit. When we receive your trade-in, we'll verify its condition and if everything checks out, your trade-in will be complete. If your device doesn’t match the condition you described, you’ll receive an email with next steps. If you paid in full and the value of your device was more than the cost of your new Apple Watch, you’ll receive an Apple Gift Card by email with the remaining amount. The online trade-in process generally takes 2-3 weeks. You can also trade your device in at an Apple Store at the point of purchase, however the trade-in value in store may be different from the estimated trade-in value you received online.
