Shop How does HP Instant Ink work? HP Instant Ink is based on pages, not cartridges. Choose a plan based on the number of pages you would like to print monthly. Your monthly fee allows you to use our subscription cartridges to print your plan pages and includes ink, delivery, and recycling. HP Instant Ink is flexible. And don't worry if your printing needs change. You can easily change your plan anytime or cancel the service without penalties. You can roll over unused pages month to month (the amount of pages you can accumulate varies by plan), or if you print more, you'll automatically purchase sets of 10-50 pages for $1.00 (pages per set varies by plan). Your plan can be changed at any time to accommodate your printing needs. Once you sign up for the Service, forget about going to the store again to buy cartridges! We send you HP Instant Ink subscription cartridges when you first sign up. Replacement cartridges are sent when your printer tells HP you need more ink, not by the month. Is HP Instant Ink Worth It? Yes, HP Instant Ink customers are some of our happiest customers and we have over 5000, five-star reviews. With Instant Ink you will always have ink when you need it. Ink is delivered automatically when you run low, not necessarily every month. Most customers save on ink and many save up to 50% versus buying traditional ink cartridges. Instant ink cartridges hold more ink, use less packaging, and ship automatically, bringing down costs for HP, so we can pass the savings on to you. No more Ink rationing. Every page costs the same - print high-resolution photos or color documents for the same price as black and white documents. Hassle-free recycling is included. We send you a postage-paid envelope…just drop it in the mail and we do the rest. How soon will I get my ink? You will receive your ink within 7-10 days of registering. Once enrolled, you’ll receive a Welcome Kit delivered to your door. The ink cartridge you receive is special and only works with HP Instant Ink. Your next shipment of ink will be sent only when ink levels are low, not monthly. No need to worry, because your printer drops us a note and your next set of cartridges will be automatically dispatched. Simply return the old cartridges with prepaid recycling. How does the paper add-on service work? Conveniently receive our 20lb, 96 Bright HP Paper before you need it,12 in 1 or 3-ream kits (based on your ink plan). Unused sheets rollover and extra pages cost pennies. You get to print up to the same number of sheets as your ink plan (for example 50 sheets of paper for a 50-page ink plan). Change, pause or cancel your paper plan anytime.8 Select Your Country/Region and Language Close Country/Region Selector Dialog Americas América Central Argentina Bolivia Brasil Canada Canada - Français Caribbean Chile Colombia Ecuador México Paraguay Perú Puerto Rico United States Uruguay Venezuela Asia and Oceania Asia Pacific Australia Bangladesh Hong Kong SAR India Indonesia Malaysia New Zealand Pakistan Philippines Singapore Sri Lanka Việt Nam ไทย 中华人民共和国 臺灣 地區 日本 香港特別行政區 한국 Europe, Middle East and Africa Africa Afrique België Belgique Česká republika Danmark Deutschland Eesti España France Hrvatska Ireland Italia Latvija Lietuva Magyarország Middle East Nederland Nigeria Norge Österreich Polska Portugal România Saudi Arabia Slovenija Slovensko South Africa Suisse Suomi Sverige Switzerland Türkiye United Kingdom Ελλάδα България Казахстан Србија Україна ישראל الشرق الأوسط المملكة العربية السعودية End of content Country/Region : Close Country/Region Selector SelectedCanada HP Worldwide popUpSRBeginingLabelString Select Your Country/Region and Language Click or use the tab key to select your country Africa Afrique América Central Argentina Asia Pacific Australia Bangladesh België Belgique Bolivia Brasil Canada Canada - Français Caribbean Česká republika Chile Colombia Danmark Deutschland Ecuador Eesti España France Hong Kong SAR Hrvatska India Indonesia Ireland Italia Latvija Lietuva Magyarország Malaysia México Middle East Nederland New Zealand Nigeria Norge Österreich Pakistan Paraguay Perú Philippines Polska Portugal Puerto Rico România Saudi Arabia Singapore Slovenija Slovensko South Africa Sri Lanka Suisse Suomi Sverige Switzerland Türkiye United Kingdom United States Uruguay Venezuela Việt Nam Ελλάδα България Казахстан Србија Україна ישראל الشرق الأوسط المملكة العربية السعودية ไทย 中华人民共和国 臺灣 地區 日本 香港特別行政區 한국 popUpSREndingLabelString Close Country/Region Selector Dialog About Us About Us About Us Contact HP Careers Sustainable impact Newsroom Tech Takes HP Printables Newsletter Ways to buy Ways to buy Shop online Find a reseller Support Support Support Download drivers Support & troubleshooting Register your product Authorized service providers Check repair status HP Partners HP Partners HP Amplify Partner Program Stay connected Stay connected Recalls| Product recycling| Supply Chain Act| Privacy| Use of cookies| Terms of use| ©2025 HP Development Company, L.P.
