We are committed to protecting the planet. And designing products you love. Apple 2030 is our plan to do both. By focusing on recycled and renewable materials, clean electricity and low-carbon shipping, we’re working to bring our net emissions to zero across our entire carbon footprint. We’re sharing our progress — and the work that remains — so you can join us on this journey. A detailed approach. From design to disassembly. Design and Source Design our products with recycled and renewable materials.1 Our Approach Recycled and renewable materials often carry a lower carbon footprint than mined materials. By sourcing more recycled and renewable content, we can help to one day end our reliance on mining. Our Progress 22% of the materials we shipped in Apple products came from recycled or renewable sources.2 Make Source all manufacturing electricity from renewable energy. Our Approach Most of our carbon footprint comes from the electricity used to manufacture our products. So our suppliers are transitioning to electricity generated from solar, wind and other renewable sources. Our Progress Over 320 of our suppliers have already committed to using 100% renewable electricity by 2030.3 Package and Ship Package and ship our products with lower emissions. Our Approach We’re removing plastic from our packaging and making it more compact.4 And we’re prioritizing low-carbon shipping methods such as ocean, rail and electric vehicles. Our Progress More than 97% of our packaging is now fibre‑based.5 Use Match 100% of our products’ energy use with clean electricity.6 Our Approach To address the electricity used to charge and run our products, we’re investing in global renewable energy projects around the world. And we’re making these products even more energy-efficient. Our Progress We’re matching 100% of the expected customer electricity use for Mac mini and select Apple Watch options by investing in projects like the IP Radian Solar project.7 Recover Maximize the materials we recover from recycled products. Our Approach We’re creating technologies, such as our disassembly robot Daisy, to recover critical materials so they can be recycled and reused.8 Our Progress In 2023, we recycled nearly 40,000 metric tons of electronic materials. Our progress by the numbers. We’ve expanded our lineup of carbon-neutral products to include Apple Watch Series 10 and Mac mini.9 Over 55% reduction in CO₂e emissions across our carbon footprint since 2015. 18.5M metric tons of CO₂e emissions avoided through our Supplier Clean Energy Program in 2023. 22% of materials shipped in our products came from recycled and renewable sources in 2023.2 12.8M devices and accessories sent to new owners for reuse in 2023. 20% reduction in product transportation emissions compared to 2022. The proof is in our products. The same innovative thinking that goes into creating the products you love goes into our environmental initiatives. And as we design durable products, we’re also using smarter chemistry to make sure they’re safer for everyone who assembles, uses and recycles them.

View all product innovations Partnerships that do a world of good. Doing right by the planet means doing right by the people who live on it — especially those most impacted by environmental risks. So we’re supporting partners and communities worldwide. Because we can achieve more together than we can alone. Carbon removal. It’s in our nature. Carbon removal. It’s in our nature. As we continue to reduce our footprint, we’re also investing in high-quality, nature-based carbon removal projects to balance the emissions we can’t yet avoid. Partnering with Goldman Sachs and Conservation International, we created a first-of-its-kind initiative called the Restore Fund. It aims to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere by investing in projects that restore forests, wetlands and grasslands — while offering a financial return. We expect to exceed our goal of removing 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the air by 2025 from this first fund. The Restore Fund has invested in three high-quality forestry managers. Our first project is in Paraguay through an investment in Arbaro Advisors. We’re supporting their efforts to develop sustainably certified working forests while creating opportunities for local communities. We’re also partnering with Symbiosis to help them grow native hardwood trees, and restore biodiversity in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest. And with BTG Pactual Timberland Investment Group, we’re supporting their efforts to restore forests and protect natural ecosystems in Brazil. In 2023, we announced an expansion of the Restore Fund with up to an additional $200 million committed to Climate Asset Management — a joint venture between HSBC and Pollination. And in 2024, we added another $80 million commitment from key manufacturing partners Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Murata Manufacturing. UP NEXT Conserving water like the earth depends on it. Conserving water like the earth depends on it. Conserving water like the earth depends on it. Water is among the planet’s most precious resources. So to protect it, we’re going beyond our corporate footprint, across our supply chain, and into the communities and watersheds where we operate. Our supply chain accounts for 99% of our total water footprint. Through our Clean Water Program, we help train our suppliers to better reuse and recycle water. Thanks to this partnership, our participating suppliers are now reusing and recycling water in their factories at an average rate of 42%, which reduces the amount of freshwater we withdraw by billions of litres every year. In addition, five of our data centres — in Prineville, Oregon; Reno, Nevada; Mesa, Arizona; Maiden, North Carolina; and Viborg, Denmark — as well as 20 of our supplier facilities, have achieved certification to the Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard for leading water management practices in their regions. UP NEXT More renewable electricity. More readily available. More renewable electricity. More readily available. More renewable electricity. More readily available. We’re actively working to democratize access to renewable electricity around the globe. Because clean energy benefits all of us, our communities and the environment. Our Power for Impact initiative gives local communities and organizations access to cost-effective energy while supporting their economic growth and championing social impact. Solar projects in 20 countries, including South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Philippines, help provide clean energy to the communities that need it most. In 2018, we launched the China Clean Energy Fund to accelerate renewable progress in China. Together with our suppliers, we’ve invested in 1000 megawatts of clean energy. Additionally, through the RE100 initiative, we partner with the world’s most influential businesses that have committed to using 100% renewable electricity. And by forming groups like the Asia Clean Energy Coalition, we’re using our voice to support laws and policies that promote more renewable energy across Asia. UP NEXT Carbon removal. It's in our nature. Help make Mother Nature proud. There are many small actions you can take to make a big difference for the planet. Trade in your device for credit. Or recycle it for free.

Learn more at apple.com/ca/supply-chain. Apple reports data about the recycled content of its products at different levels of fidelity, based on the level of independent data verification. The bulk of Apple’s recycled content data is certified and thus verified by an independent third party. Less than 3% of the total mass shipped in Apple products in fiscal year 2023 contains recycled content that is either supplier verified, meaning it has been reported by the supplier and cross-checked by Apple, or supplier-reported, meaning it has been reported by the supplier based on production and allocation values. In all cases, Apple defines recycled content in alignment with ISO 14021. We do not currently include industry-average recycled content, which may result in underreporting actual recycled content. Total recycled material shipped in products is driven by product material composition and total sales — as a result, this overall recycled or renewable content percentage may fluctuate based on the number and type of products sold each year. Figure is as of April 2024. Apple’s goal to remove plastic from packaging includes retail bags, all finished goods boxes (including plastic content in labels and in-box documentation), packaging sent to our customers as part of Apple Trade In, AppleCare packaging for whole units and service modules (with the exception of plastics needed to protect items from electrostatic discharge), and secondary packaging of Apple products and accessories sold by Apple. Our goal does not include the inks, coatings, or adhesives used in our packaging. Responsible sourcing of wood fiber is defined in Apple’s Responsible Fiber Specification. We consider wood fibers to include bamboo. For more information about our work to protect and create responsibly managed forests, please read our Environmental Progress Report. Renewable electricity refers to fossil fuel-free sources of energy, like wind, solar, and low-impact hydroelectricity projects. Clean electricity refers to both renewable electricity and other projects that Apple considers “low carbon” but not “renewable,” like nuclear and large-impact hydroelectricity projects, which may be included as a result of low-carbon electricity provided by the grid. Apple is matching 100% of expected electricity consumption for Mac mini and the following Apple Watch products: Apple Watch Series 10, aluminum Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Ultra 2 when paired with a carbon-neutral band. More information is available in the product environmental reports for Mac mini, Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Daisy can disassemble 29 iPhone models — including various models between iPhone 5 and iPhone 14 Pro. More information is available in the product environmental reports for Mac mini, Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Ultra 2. Manufacturing electricity for Mac mini and all carbon-neutral Apple Watch products is sourced from renewable electricity, including a mix of supplier and Apple clean-energy projects. Renewable electricity refers to fossil fuel–free sources of energy, like wind, solar and low-impact hydroelectricity projects. 50% of Mac mini computers by weight are shipped by non-air modes of transportation, like ocean freight, from the factory to their next destination. Does not include iMac or Mac Pro. 50% of the combined weight of carbon-neutral Apple Watch products are shipped by non-air modes of transportation, like ocean freight, from the factory to their next destination. 100% recycled aluminum in the case applies to Apple Watch SE and Apple Watch Series 5 through Series 10. It does not include Apple Watch Ultra and Apple Watch Ultra 2. The Apple Watch Series 10 box is the same as the Apple Watch Series 9 box, which was designed to increase the total number of boxes we can fit on a pallet by 25% compared with Apple Watch Series 8.
