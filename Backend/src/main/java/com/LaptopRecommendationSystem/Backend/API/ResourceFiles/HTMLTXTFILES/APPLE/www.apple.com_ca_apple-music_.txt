Apple Music is also available on Windows and Android devices, Sonos speakers, Amazon Echo, Google Nest, smart TVs and more. What does Apple Music cost? That all depends on which offer you choose.

(3) The Apple Music Family Plan, which allows you to share your account with up to five people and gives each member a personal account, is just $16.99 per month.

Students get the same Apple Music features and benefits as individual members. Once your student status with your college or university is verified, you get student membership pricing for up to four years, as long as you remain a student. After four years, your membership will continue at the individual member price. Does Siri work with all plans? Yes. With a Siri-enabled device and any Apple Music plan, you can enjoy all the features of Apple Music and Siri. All plans also support Type to Siri. What is Dolby Atmos music and how can I listen to it? Dolby Atmos is an audio technology that creates an immersive listening experience in which sound comes from all around you. Apple Music subscribers using the latest version of Apple Music on iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV 4K can listen to thousands of Dolby Atmos music tracks using any headphones. When you listen with compatible Apple or Beats headphones or most Bluetooth headphones, Dolby Atmos music plays back automatically when available for a song. For other headphones, go to Settings > Music > Audio and set Dolby Atmos to Always On. You can also hear Dolby Atmos music using the built‑in speakers on a compatible iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air or iMac, or by connecting your Apple TV 4K to one of the following: HomePod speakers set up as the default speakers, a Dolby Atmos–compatible sound bar, a Dolby Atmos–enabled AV receiver or a television that supports Dolby Atmos audio. For the full list of compatible devices, please see support.apple.com/en-ca/HT212182. What is lossless audio and how can I listen to it? Lossless audio compression reduces the original file size of a song while preserving all of the data perfectly. Apple Music is making its entire catalogue of more than 100 million songs available in lossless audio at different resolutions. In Apple Music, “Lossless” refers to lossless audio up to 48kHz and “Hi‑Res Lossless” refers to lossless audio from 48kHz to 192kHz. Lossless and Hi‑Res Lossless files are very large and use much more bandwidth and storage space than standard AAC files. You can listen to lossless audio using the latest Apple Music app on an iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV 4K. Turn on lossless audio in Settings > Music > Audio Quality. You can choose between Lossless and Hi-Res Lossless for cellular or Wi-Fi connections. Note that Hi-Res Lossless requires external equipment such as a USB digital to analog converter. For a full list of compatible devices, please see support.apple.com/en-ca/HT212183. Can I share with my family? Yes. With an Apple Music Family Plan, up to six people in the family can enjoy all the features and the full catalogue of Apple Music. To get started, just set up Family Sharing on your iOS or iPadOS device, Android phone or Mac and invite family members to join. Are there commercials? Apple Music has zero ads. Am I eligible for a three-month Apple Music free offer? How do I redeem it? New subscribers can get three months of Apple Music free with an eligible device. To redeem the offer for iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple TV, set up your new device. To redeem the offer for AirPods, HomePod, or Beats headphones or speakers, connect or pair your eligible device to an iPhone or iPad running the latest version of iOS or iPadOS. To redeem the offer for Apple Watch, connect or pair your eligible device to an iPhone running the latest version of iOS. You’ll have three months to redeem the offer after the first activation of the eligible device.◊ What is Apple Music Classical? Apple Music Classical is a companion app for Apple Music subscribers. Included with Apple Music plans for Individual, Family and Student subscribers as well as Apple One, at no additional cost, Apple Music Classical is a dedicated classical music service designed by and for all types of classical music listeners. Classical music experts will delight in the largest collection of its kind, excellent search capability and the high‑quality audio that classical music deserves. If you’re new to the genre, you can discover classical music through curated playlists, intuitive browsing and detailed descriptions of works. Why a separate app for classical music? Classical music is different from contemporary genres. Works have multiple movements and tracks; famous pieces have hundreds of recordings with different orchestras, conductors and soloists. Apple Music Classical is tailored to the needs of classical music lovers — with a unique approach to search, browse, library and recommendation features. Listeners can also dive deeper with background information about artists, composers and works. How do I get Apple Music Classical and where can I listen to it? You can download the Apple Music Classical app from the App Store or Google Play. It’s available for iPhone and iPad with iOS or iPadOS 16.0 or later, and for Android smartphones with OS 9 (Pie) or later. Apple Music Classical has a shared library with Apple Music, which means that the classical tracks, albums and playlists added in Apple Music or Apple Music Classical are instantly available in both apps. You can listen on all your devices, including in the car with CarPlay — online or offline. You’ll need Apple Music installed on the same device you use for Apple Music Classical. Apple Music is usually preinstalled on iPhone and iPad. Apple Music Classical is included with all Apple Music plans at no extra charge — there’s no separate subscription. If you’re not yet an Apple Music subscriber, it’s easy to sign up from Apple Music or Apple Music Classical. Is classical music still available in Apple Music? Yes, both apps offer the largest classical catalogue in the world. However, Apple Music Classical includes multiple additional features, such as classical browse, a search engine designed for classical music, handpicked recommendations, composer and artist bios, and descriptions of the works. Does Apple Music Classical also offer other genres? No, Apple Music Classical is classical only, but it does include lots of film and other crossover genres with classical music. Apple Music Classical users can also listen to more than 100 million songs on Apple Music through their subscription. Working with Apple Music.
