Which devices are eligible for trade-in? You can trade in many different Apple devices for trade-in credit or an Apple Gift Card. If your device isnâ€™t eligible for any trade-in value, you can still recycle it with Apple for free. Can I trade in an engraved device? Yes, engraved Apple products are eligible for trade-in. If the device was engraved by Apple, its trade-in value wonâ€™t be impacted. However, third-party engraving may affect your deviceâ€™s value. How much will I get for my device? It depends on the device, model, manufacturer and condition. Answer a few questions accurately, and once we receive the device within the specified time frame and verify its condition, youâ€™ll most likely receive the full amount of the estimated refund. Keep in mind that we need to receive your trade-in within 15 days of receiving your new device, and the condition of your trade-in needs to match what you told us. Can I get an estimate online, then trade in at an Apple Store? Yes, the Apple Trade In program is available on apple.com as well as in all our retail stores. A Specialist will evaluate your device on the spot, so the trade-in credit you get in the store may differ from the estimated trade-in value you received online if the condition doesnâ€™t match what you described. How do I find the serial number on my Apple device? On your iPhone, Apple Watch or iPad, go to Settings > General and tap About. On Mac devices, click the ï£¿ menu and go to About This Mac. If youâ€™re still unable to find your serial number, follow this guide(Opens in a new window). Youâ€™ll need the serial number to see an accurate trade-in value for your iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple Watch. Why canâ€™t I pay monthly after I add my trade-in? In some cases, you will be eligible to receive your trade-in value as an instant credit when you choose monthly payments, reducing the order total (the amount to be financed). If your trade-in value is close to the price of your new device, then the remaining amount due becomes too low to qualify for financing. You can continue your transaction by choosing to pay in full, and youâ€™ll receive your trade-in value when the device is received and verified. Learn more about financing offers(Opens in a new window) If I buy a new device online with a trade-in, when will the credit be applied? It depends on what you buy and how you pay for it. If you buy an iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple Watch and pay in full, your credit will be applied to your original payment method, up to the total purchase price, after we receive your trade-in device and confirm that the condition matches what you have described. For any remaining amount, youâ€™ll receive an Apple Gift Card by email. If you buy an iPhone, iPad, Mac or Apple Watch with a trade-in and choose a monthly payment option, your estimated trade-in credit will be applied directly to the purchase price of your new Apple device. Once we receive your trade-in device and confirm that the condition matches what you described, thereâ€™s nothing more you need to do. If it doesnâ€™t match, your original payment method will be charged the difference in value. In that case, weâ€™ll work with you to confirm that you still want to proceed with the trade-in. How long does the online trade-in process take? Generally it takes 2â€“3 weeks. Your trade-in device needs to be sent to us within 15 days of receiving your new device. The sooner we receive your trade-in, the sooner we can verify its condition and process your credit or gift card. It may take 3â€“5 business days for your credit to be processed. How quickly should I return my device? Your trade-in estimate is valid for 15 days after you receive your new device. Itâ€™s important that we receive your trade-in within this timeframe to ensure you get the estimated value. Do I need to return accessories to get the full trade-in value? You donâ€™t have to, but you can always send in your chargers, cables, cases, and watch straps and we will recycle them responsibly. However, if you cancel your trade-in, weâ€™ll be unable to return them to you. How do I send back my device? Weâ€™ll either send you a prepaid trade-in kit or email you with drop-off instructions. If we send you a trade-in kit, it will include instructions on how to prepare and package your device.

How do I transfer my data to my new device? Once you receive your new device, follow the instructions in the trade-in email or trade-in kit on how to transfer your personal data. Is there a way to track my trade-in status? Yes. If you bought a new device online with a trade-in or youâ€™re receiving an Apple Gift Card, you can track your status(Opens in a new window) at any time. Can I cancel a trade-in? If you havenâ€™t dropped off or shipped your device yet, you can cancel your trade-in by simply keeping your device. If youâ€™ve already sent us your device, the trade-in canâ€™t be cancelled. However, if you receive a lower revised trade-in value after weâ€™ve inspected your device, you can choose to reject it. If you buy a new device online with a trade-in and return the new device, your trade-in will be cancelled automatically and in some cases it may not be possible to return your device. Why did I receive a revised trade-in value offer? If the condition of your device is different from what you described, weâ€™ll provide a revised value. If the revised value is lower than the initial estimate, you can either accept or reject it. If you accept it, weâ€™ll continue with the trade-in. If you paid monthly and received an instant credit, weâ€™ll charge the difference in value to the provided payment method. If you paid in full, the revised amount will be credited to your original payment method (or in some cases, via bank transfer). If you reject it, weâ€™ll cancel the trade-in and return your old device. If the revised value increases, weâ€™ll automatically increase your trade-in credit.

Does Apple offer recycling? Yes. Apple Trade In lets you recycle any Apple device at an Apple Store location and on apple.com for free. Items accepted for recycling include the device as well as batteries, cables, cases, monitors, packaging and more. Free recycling is available to our commercial, education and institutional customers. When we receive your device, it will be thoroughly inspected and assessed for reuse or recycling. Whether recycled or reused, all activities relating to the processing of your device will be managed in an environmentally responsible way. How do I prepare my device for recycling? Before you send us your device by post or drop it off at an Apple Store, make sure you have backed up your data. After saving your data, remove any personal data from the device you wish to recycle. You will no longer have access to the device after recycling it with Apple. If you are sending your old device by post, please note: Devices that contain batteries should be packed in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices, which typically include the guidelines below: Do not send loose batteries. Discharge the unit to less than 30%. Do not send electronics that are disassembled into parts. Do not send electronics with swollen, damaged or defective batteries. For whole units, surround the product with at least 6 centimetres of suitable filler material, such as recycled or reused packaging, before placing it inside a corrugated box. Send only one device per box. Footer footnotes Tradeâ€‘in values will vary based on the condition, year and configuration of your eligible tradeâ€‘in device. Not all devices are eligible for credit.
