The potentially affected batteries may have been shipped with specific HP ProBook (64x G2 and G3 series, 65x G2 and G3 series, 4xx G4 (430, 440, 450, 455, and 470)), HP x360 310 G2, HP ENVY m6, HP Pavilion x360 15 inch, HP 11 Notebook Computers and HP ZBook (17 G3, 17 G4, and Studio G3 & G4) Mobile Workstations sold worldwide from December 2015 through October 2018. Additionally, these batteries may have been sold as accessories or replacement batteries for HP ProBook 4xx G5 (430, 440, 450, 455, and 470), HP ENVY 15, and HP Mobile Thin Clients (mt20, mt21, and mt31) or for any of the preceding products from December 2015 through December 2018 through HP or an authorized Service Provider. These batteries have the potential to overheat, posing a fire and burn hazard to customers.

As many of these batteries are internal to system and are not customer replaceable, HP is releasing an update to the BIOS for batteries affected by this program expansion that will discharge the battery and disable future charging until the battery is replaced. HP customers affected by this program will be eligible to receive replacement battery services for each verified, affected battery at no cost.
