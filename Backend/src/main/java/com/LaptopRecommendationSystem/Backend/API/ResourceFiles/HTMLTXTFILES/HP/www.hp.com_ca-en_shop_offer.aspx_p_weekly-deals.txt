Every week we offer up some of the best savings in the tech world. Here’s your chance to upgrade your office tech and bring home first-rate HP devices at only a fraction of their regular cost. At HP®, our goal is to enhance everyone’s ability to live conveniently and productively in the digital age by offering them world-class products at great prices. Our HP Store weekly deals enable us to further that goal. Every week you’ll have the chance to earn big savings on the best tech we have available. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a casual or power PC user - every week you’re bound to find an HP laptop deal or other HP device that’s perfect for your tech needs. Premium business laptops Laptops are one of our specialties. We have a wide array of laptops that are perfect for anyone, from students to entrepreneurs to creative professionals to gamers. Our weekly laptop deals grant you the opportunity to save big on models from all of our major series. If you’re in business, it’s safe to assume you spend a lot of hours doing work outside the office. Whether you work in a coffee shop, on a train, or on a plane, you need a laptop that’s durable, secure, and has great battery life. You’ll find some of the best business laptops at HP. Our HP EliteBook series and HP ProBook series are built for the working professional who’s always working on-the-go. These notebooks are built with either Intel® Core™ or AMD® Ryzen™ processors, so you’re able to run multiple applications simultaneously without any lag time. Many of these laptops are customizable, too, so you can boost the storage capacity, memory (RAM), and processors to get exactly what you need. But you won’t only find deals on business laptops. You’ll be able to save on all types of HP laptops, from gaming computers to workstations. Print anything from anywhere Our HP Canada Weekly Deals might offer you the best chance to save on our laser printers . HP printers are perfect for both home and office use. Do you need to make beautiful color prints? Whether you’re printing memos or brochures for your business, or you’re just printing your favorite photos to frame in your home, you can rely on our HP inkjet printers to make gorgeous prints on a variety of paper types and sizes. Many of our inkjet printers are also capable of copying, scanning, and faxing. But if you have high-volume printing needs, then you’ll want to find a deal on one of our HP laser printers. Our laser printers can print a massive volume of documents at very fast speeds - up to 40 pages per minute (ppm) on some models. Laser printers are perfect for offices because of their size and speed, but we also produce smaller laser printers that are great for the home or for students who need to print out lengthy notes and readings. Save on mobile workstations When you’re working on processing-intensive projects, it’s easier to get the job done at a large desktop workstation. But sometimes you don’t have that luxury. Maybe you’re a video editor who needs to be on set, an engineer who needs to run simulations on-site, or a digital illustrator who needs to make sketches of real-world objects. Whatever the case may be, our advanced HP mobile workstations are able to give you supreme computing power on a smaller mobile device. The HP ZBook family is a great choice for professionals who can’t afford to skimp on power or performance. And during our Weekly Deals, you might be able to reap big savings on this advanced laptop series. Not only do these laptops have strong Intel Core processors, but they also have dedicated graphics cards so you’re able to perform 4K editing and 3D rendering at fast speeds. We’ve engineered these laptops with ventilation-efficient designs so your hardware will stay cool while you’re working. Tune in weekly to find laptop computer deals on mobile workstations, 2-in-1 laptops, and laptop accessories. Upgrade your gaming rig for less HP is your one-stop-shop for gaming computer deals.
