Call us at 1-866-390-1160 Frequently Asked Questions How can a customized PC enhance business productivity? A customized PC allows businesses to select components that match their specific operational needs, leading to optimized performance for tasks such as data analysis, design, or customer service. This tailored approach ultimately boosts productivity by ensuring that the hardware is perfectly suited to the business's requirements. What are the benefits of purchasing a configured PC from HP? HP's Configure Your PC program offers tailored configurations for compatibility, durability, and cost savings. All configured PCs come with a complimentary 3-year Care Pack and Wolf Security pack for extended support and enhanced security, ensuring that your investment is protected and your business operations run smoothly. What are the different Form Factors? The form factor refers to the size and design of the computer, which dictates the overall build and functionality. HP provides a variety of options to accommodate different needs and preferences. For desktops, HP offers Mini, Small Form Factor (SFF), Tower, and All-in-One (AiO) configurations. Mini PCs are space-efficient and versatile, perfect for modern workspaces. SFF desktops are compact and suitable for space-conscious users while still offering great performance. Towers provide ample space for components and future upgrades, making them ideal for high-performance needs. AiO PCs integrate the computer and display into a single unit, offering a clean and clutter-free setup. For Notebooks, HP offers Traditional Clamshell, 2-in-1 Convertible, and Mobile Workstation. Traditional Clamshell laptops feature the standard design with a keyboard and display connected by a hinge, allowing the laptop to open and close like a clamshell. 2-in-1 Convertibles can transform into tablet mode by rotating the screen 360 degrees. Mobile Workstations are powerful laptops designed for demanding professional applications. Can I change or add products to my recent order? Once your order is placed, it cannot be changed. We are unable to change or add to the order no matter how small the change may be. What is the return policy of my recent order? All HP customized products are eligible for 30-days returns.
